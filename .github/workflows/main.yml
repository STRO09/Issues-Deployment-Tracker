    # GitHub provides virtual machines (runners)
    # 'ubuntu-latest' is free, fast, and has Java/Maven preinstalled

    steps:
      # Step 1: Get your repository code into the runner
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4  

      # Step 2: Install Java (JDK 8 in your case)
      - name: Set up JDK 8
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '8'        # Java version required for your project
          distribution: 'temurin'  # Open-source JDK distribution

      # Step 3: Define environment variable for test environment
      # $GITHUB_ENV is a special file to persist env vars between steps
      - name: Set environment to test
        run: echo "ENVIRONMENT=test" >> $GITHUB_ENV  

      # Step 4: Build the project and run JUnit tests using Maven
      # -B means batch mode (non-interactive, cleaner CI logs)
      # 'clean' removes old builds, 'verify' compiles and runs tests
      # to only build the backend
